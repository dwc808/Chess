# About This Project

This project was initially created as a final project for CS162 at Oregon State. The task was to create a chess mini-game, where each color started with a limited set of pieces, on the same side of the board, and raced their kings to the other side. No moves that left either king in check were allowed. I have since returned to this project to make a complete chess game. All standard chess moves and rules are implemented with a unit testing suite.

# Work in Progress

This game is still in progress. All chess rules have been implemented and tested. Remaining tasks are:

- Build a GUI for the game with tkinter
- Implement an AI opponent
- Continue to refactor, improving readability and moving more functionality into the Piece class
- Improve test coverage
